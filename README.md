Welcome to the E-commerce Recommendation System project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to build a recommendation engine that enhances the user experience on e-commerce platforms by suggesting relevant products. This project is designed to help users find items they’re most likely interested in, based on their browsing and purchase history, as well as the behaviors of similar users.

Project Overview

Goal:  The goal of this project is to develop a system that provides personalized recommendations, improving customer engagement and potentially increasing sales. By understanding user preferences and browsing patterns, we can deliver suggestions that feel intuitive and helpful.

Features

Personalized Recommendations: Suggests products tailored to each user's preferences.
Trending Products: Highlights popular items based on overall platform activity.
Similar Product Recommendations: Recommends items that are similar to the current product a user is viewing.
User Behavior Insights: Uses collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to improve recommendations.
Dataset
We’ll be using a dataset that includes:

User Data: Basic details about users, including IDs and behavioral patterns.
Product Data: Information about products such as category, price, and popularity.
Transaction Data: Records of user purchases, timestamps, and session logs.
Tech Stack
To implement this recommendation system, we are using:

Python for general programming and data manipulation.
Pandas & Numpy for data preprocessing and manipulation.
Scikit-learn for building and testing machine learning models.
Surprise library for collaborative filtering-based recommendation.
