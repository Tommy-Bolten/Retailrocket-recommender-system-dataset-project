Summary: This project developed a collaborative filtering recommendation system for an e-commerce platform to improve user engagement with personalized product suggestions. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was used to factorize the user-item interaction matrix and predict user preferences accurately.

Process:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Data from Kaggle, including category trees, user interaction events, and item metadata, was preprocessed by merging datasets, handling missing values, and converting timestamps.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed user engagement patterns, top items, and interaction trends, using visualizations to understand user behaviors.
Feature Engineering: Created features for users, items, and interactions, incorporating metrics like event counts, conversion rates, and interaction timing.
Model Development and Tuning: The dataset was split (80% training, 20% test), and GridSearchCV was applied to optimize SVD hyperparameters, resulting in parameters that minimized errors.
Model Evaluation: The SVD model achieved strong performance with low MAE (0.0206) and RMSE (0.1787), demonstrating high predictive accuracy.


Results: The recommendation engine can now deliver personalized product recommendations, target users for marketing campaigns, and optimize inventory management based on demand forecasts. Future improvements may include hybrid recommendation methods, real-time updates, and solutions for cold start issues.
