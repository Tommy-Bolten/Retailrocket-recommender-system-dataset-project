Model Evaluation Metrics for SVD-based Collaborative Filtering
=============================================================

Best Hyperparameters (after Grid Search):
----------------------------------------
- n_factors: 10
- n_epochs: 20
- lr_all: 0.002
- reg_all: 0.1

Model Performance:
-------------------
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0206
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0319
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1787

Training Dataset:
-----------------
- Number of Users: 87,723
- Number of Items: 50,084
- Number of Interactions: 100,000 (Sampled Data)

Test Dataset:
-------------
- Number of Users: 87,723 (same as train due to splitting)
- Number of Items: 50,084
- Number of Interactions: 20,000 (Test set)

Model Summary:
--------------
- The recommendation system is based on matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- GridSearchCV was used to tune hyperparameters to achieve the best RMSE.
- The final model performed with an RMSE of 0.1787, indicating strong predictive performance for user-item interaction prediction.
